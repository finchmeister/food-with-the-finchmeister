1. Over a medium heat, add the olive oil to a large pan, then once hot,
add the chopped onions and wait 5 minutes, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon, 
until a little soft.

2. Add the chopped peppers, chilli and garlic to pan, then add the spices:
Chilli powder, paprika and ground cumin.
Feel free to vary the amount of chilli powder depending on your heat tolerance. 
Leave it for 5 mins, giving it a good stir every now and then.

3. Max out the heat on the pan, then drop the mince in. Break it up, 
stirring occasionally until fully browned. Dash some worcester sauce as it cooks.

4. It's time for the sauce. Crumble a beef stock cube into 300ml of boiling water, 
then pour it into the pan with a can of chopped tomatoes. 
Add the dried marjoram and dark chocolate with plenty of seasoning. 
Also squirt in 2 tbsp of tomato purée.

5. Bring the whole mixture to a lively simmer. Give it a good stir then put a lid on the pan.
Continue the lively simmer for around 20 minutes stirring every 5.

6. Drain and rinse the can of kidney beans in a sieve. Add them to the pan and stir.
Without the lid on, simmer the chilli for another 10 minutes. 
The sauce should be starting to reduce nicely now. 
If it's not, increase the heat and/or simmer for a bit longer.

7. Check the flavouring, adding a good amount of salt and pepper.
Let the chilli stand for 10 minutes, meanwhile boil the rice.
Use a 2:1 ratio of water to rice adding more water if necessary as the rice cooks. 
Once the rice is cooked to your liking, serve the chilli adding soured cream and cheddar if you wish.
