1. In a large pan, on a high heat, fry the seasoned chicken in oil for 7 minutes until golden all over,
then remove from the pan and cover in foil.
2. Lower the heat slightly then add the bacon and onions to the pan. 
Fry until the onions have softened and the bacon is cooked, add the crushed garlic 5 minutes in.
3. Measure the flour in a bowl, then add the wine in, whisking
constantly until smooth. Add to the pan with the chopped tomatoes and sugar.
Bring to the boil, then add the chicken - juices and all - to the pan. Bring
to a gentle simmer and leave on the hob with the lid on for 30 minutes.
4. Perhaps 10 minutes before the chicken is done. In a large frying pan,
fry the mushrooms in butter until golden and cooked. Then add the mushrooms in with
the chicken and stir in the thyme. Leave for a few minutes.
5. Serve with mashed potato and green vegetables of your choice.
